# Readme

This project transcribes audio files into text and further converts the text into ARPAbet phonemes with start and end timestamps. It primarily utilizes `whisper` for speech-to-text conversion, `nltk` for dictionary access, `g2p_en` for grapheme to phoneme conversion, and `json` for output formatting.

## Dependencies

To execute the code in this project, the following Python libraries are required:

- `whisper_timestamped`: A library used for automatic speech recognition (ASR). At the time of my knowledge cut-off (September 2021), there isn't a library named `whisper_timestamped`. pip3 install git+https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped
- `nltk`: The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language.
- `cmudict`: This is not a standalone library, but a corpus that comes with `nltk`. It's a large pronunciation dictionary of English words.
- `json`: A built-in Python library for dealing with JSON data.
- `g2p_en`: A library used for Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion. It converts written text into the phonemes that represent spoken language.

Please make sure that you have the latest versions of these libraries to avoid any discrepancies.

## Installation 

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
pip install g2p_en
```

To download the required NLTK corpus:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('cmudict')
```

## Running the Code

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the code by:

1. Importing the necessary libraries.
2. Loading the audio file and ASR model.
3. Transcribing the audio to text.
4. Converting the transcribed text to phonemes with timestamps.
5. Saving the result as a JSON file.

Ensure you have the necessary audio file and model in your directory. You may need to adjust file paths or names according to your specific setup.

Note: This README is based on the information available up until September 2021, and some details might have changed for software/tools used after this date.
